# isilon
Tools developed over the years for Isilon. Mostly python, some bash/perl. 

Most of these scripts are intended as a once a day snapshot/healthcheck of the Isilon clusters. The reports are intended to be sent via SMTP with the email body
having HTML/CSS formating with a management summary view of what is being checked. In addition, there will be an attached spreadsheet(actual .xlsx) with many accurate
details.
